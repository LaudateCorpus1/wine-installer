In Linux Mint 19.x
------------------

`wine-installer` is a metapackage which depends on winehq-stable (which is part of the Mint repos), or winehq-devel or winehq-staging.

It also depends on `wine-desktop-files` which adds missing desktop files and `winetricks` which is handy and necessary libraries.
